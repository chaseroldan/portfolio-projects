The song wasn\\'t intended as a youth-mutiny anthem at first. It was a Jimmy Reed-style blues, reflecting Townshend\\'s fears about the impending strictures of adult life, famously captured in the line \"Hope I die before I get old.\" \"My Generation\\' was very much about trying to find a place in society,\" he told\\xa0Rolling Stone\\xa0in 1987. \"I was very, very lost. The band was young then. It was believed that its career would be incredibly brief.\" Instead, \"My Generation\" became the Who\\'s ticket to legend \\x97 their first British Top Five hit, and a battle cry for young mod rebels \\x97 and it established Townshend as a fearless and eloquent songwriter. \"My Generation\" went through months of arranging and rerecording before the Who got it right, in two takes, on October 13th, 1965. Townshend opened the song with a two-chord assault that beat punk rock to the punch by more than a decade. Bassist John Entwistle took the solo breaks with crisp, grunting aggression \\x97 he had to buy three new basses to finish the recording, since his Danelectro\\'s strings kept breaking and replacement strings weren\\'t available.

There are no other\\xa0Beatles\\xa0on the record. None were needed. George Martin\\'s arrangement for a string quartet emphasized lower-octave melancholy, while McCartney\\'s almost whispered vocal reverberated with longing in the big, dark spaces where drums and electric guitars would have been. The melody, he said, came to him in a dream: \"My dad used to know a lot of old jazz tunes, I thought maybe I\\'d just remembered it from the past.\" McCartney auditioned the song for Martin, with the working title \"Scrambled Eggs,\" in a hotel room in Paris in January 1964 \\x97 before the Beatles had even landed in America \\x97 but would not record it for another year and a half. \"We were a little embarrassed about it,\" McCartney confessed. \"We were a rock &amp; roll band.\" A Number One single in America, \"Yesterday\" was, in his own words, \"the most complete song I have ever written.\"</td>      <td>Help!\\xa0(Capitol/Apple)</td>      <td>John Lennon, Paul McCartney</td>      <td>George Martin</td>      <td>11 weeks</td>      <td>No. 1</td>      <td>Sep</td>      <td>1965</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <th>Bob Dylan</th>      <td>Blowin\\' in the Wind</td>      <td>In April 1962, at Gerde\\'s Folk City in New York\\'s Greenwich Village, 20-year-old\\xa0Bob Dylan\\xa0gave a quick speech before playing one of his new songs: \"This here ain\\'t no protest song or anything like that, \\'cause I don\\'t write no protest songs,\" he said.

So he and\\xa0John Lennon\\xa0went to the home of the parents of Jane Asher, McCartney\\'s girlfriend, where \\x97 \"one on one, eyeball to eyeball,\" as Lennon put it \\x97 they wrote \"I Want to Hold Your Hand,\" an irresistibly erotic come-on framed as a chaste, bashful request. The lightning-bolt energy of their collaboration ran through the band\\'s performance, taped October 17th, 1963. It lunges out of the speakers with a rhythm so tricky that the first wave of bands to cover the song often couldn\\'t figure it out; Lennon and McCartney constantly switch between unison and harmonies, both of them snapping and whooping like they own the melody. Every element of the song is a hook, from Lennon\\'s\\xa0Chuck Berry\\xa0riffing to\\xa0George Harrison\\'s string-snapping guitar fills to the quartet\\'s syncopated hand claps.

For the first time, Hendrix, bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell got to show off their acrobatic onstage chemistry on record \\x97 and they somehow managed to condense it to an under-three-minute blaze of overdubbed guitar sorcery. (The first chord of its main riff has come to be known among guitarists as the \"Hendrix chord.\") The song, which Hendrix wrote on December 26th, 1966, in the dressing room of a London club, also served as a showcase for his brilliant, often contradictory lyrical gifts (boiled down from a much longer initial draft called \"Purple Haze \\x97 Jesus Saves\"). He spiked the surging rhythmic confidence of the Experience with intimate pictorial tension: \"Actin\\' funny, but I don\\'t know why/\\'Scuse me while I kiss the sky.\" (Hendrix later said that he had written the lyrics after he\\'d had a dream in which he could walk underwater.) The Experience recorded \"Purple Haze\" across a series of sessions in January and February, 1967, experimenting with recording techniques such as the blitzed-out distortion on Hendrix\\'s guitar \\x97 when the master tape was sent to their American record label, an enclosed note diligently pointed out that the distorted sound of the song was deliberate. In the closing solo, Hendrix echoed his screaming Strat with an additional shrieking guitar put through a new harmonic-manipulation device called an Octavia and played back at double speed. \"Purple Haze\" \\x97 the opening track on the U.S. version of his debut LP,\\xa0Are You Experienced?\\xa0\\x97 captured the liberating rush of Day-Glo culture just in time for the Summer of Love.</td>      <td>Are You Experienced?\\xa0(Experience Hendrix)</td>      <td>Hendrix</td>      <td>Chas Chandler</td>      <td>8 weeks</td>      <td>No. 65</td>      <td>March</td>      <td>1967</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <th>Chuck Berry</th>      <td>Maybellene</td>      <td>Rock &amp; roll guitar starts here.

Its groove comes from \"Ida Red,\" a 1938 recording by Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys (of a song that dates back to the 19th century). By the time of the May 21st, 1955, session, Berry had been playing country tunes for black audiences for a few years \\x97 \"After they laughed at me a few times, they began requesting the hillbilly stuff,\" he has said. Leonard Chess came up with the title, inspired by a Maybelline mascara box lying on the floor at the Chess studio.

Written in 1952 by white teenagers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller for R&amp;B singer Willie Mae \"Big Mama\" Thornton, it was a smash for her, and was immediately covered by a handful of country acts. (The chorus, Leiber noted in 1987, was code for \"You ain\\'t nothin\\' but a motherfucker.\") Presley, always on the lookout for hillbilly/R&amp;B crossover possibilities, added the song to his stage act in the spring of 1956, after hearing Freddie Bell and the Bellboys sing it in Las Vegas. On June 5th of that year, his hip-swiveling performance of \"Hound Dog\" on The Milton Berle Show became an instant sensation \\x97 notorious enough that on his next TV appearance, he crooned the song to a top-hatted basset hound. The next morning, Presley and his band got deadly serious about \"Hound Dog,\" perfecting it over 31 takes at New York\\'s RCA Studios. With snarling vocal authority, D.J. Fontana\\'s tommy-gun drumrolls and slashing guitar by Scotty Moore, Presley transformed the song\\'s blues changes and put-down rhymes into a declaration of independence from his generation\\'s cold, rigid elders. \"Hound Dog\" was the flip side of \"Don\\'t Be Cruel,\" Presley\\'s third RCA single. It was also the song in which he told the world: Like it or not, rock &amp; roll is here to stay.</td>      <td>Elvis 30 #1 Hits (RCA)</td>      <td>Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller</td>      <td>Steve Sholes</td>      <td>28 weeks</td>      <td>No. 1</td>      <td>July</td>      <td>1956</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <th>The Beatles</th>      <td>Let It Be</td>      <td>Inspired by the church-born soul of Aretha Franklin, an anxious Paul McCartney started writing \"Let It Be\" in 1968, during the contentious sessions for the White Album.

John Lennon, the group\\'s resident heretic, was brutally dismissive, mistaking McCartney\\'s secular humanism for self-righteous piety.
