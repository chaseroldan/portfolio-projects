This project uses Pandas, NumPy, JavaScript, and Jupyter Notebook to analyze data about ufo sightings. It uses a dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects and appends a table to a web page with multiple filters.  A date form is also used to help listen for events and search for rows that match user input.
